## 🚀 How to Use the Improvements

### In Development
```bash
# The improvements are automatically applied
# No new setup required
# All Tailwind classes and gradients work as-is
```

### For New Components
```tsx
// Use the established patterns:
1. Add animation: animate-in fade-in duration-500
2. Add gradient: bg-linear-to-r from-primary via-primary to-primary/80
3. Add hover: hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105
4. Add transitions: transition-all duration-300
5. Stagger lists: style={{ animationDelay: `${i * 50}ms` }}
```

### Custom Animations Available
```tsx
// From globals.css
animate-smooth-fade-in
animate-smooth-slide-up/down/left/right
animate-smooth-scale-in
animate-linear-shimmer
hover:animate-lift
```
